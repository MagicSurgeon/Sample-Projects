        <h1>What is artificial intelligence (AI)?</h1>
        <h2 style="margin-left: 50px; font-size:30px;">What is the definition and scope of Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Artificial Intelligence (AI) encapsulates the emulation of human cognitive functions within machines, enabling them to simulate human thought processes and behaviors. This expansive field encompasses diverse methodologies and strategies designed to empower computers to execute activities traditionally exclusive to human intellect. Tasks within AI's purview encompass an array of complexities, such as comprehending natural language, discerning patterns, assimilating knowledge from experiences, and rendering decisions autonomously. Through advancements in machine learning, neural networks, and other AI paradigms, computers are increasingly adept at processing vast datasets and deriving insights from them, akin to human cognition. AI's applications span numerous domains, from powering virtual assistants and self-driving vehicles to optimizing business operations and healthcare diagnostics. As AI continues to evolve, its potential to revolutionize industries and augment human capabilities grows exponentially, heralding a future where machines seamlessly collaborate with humans, enhancing productivity and innovation across society.</p>

        <h1 id="tag1" style="margin-left: 60px;"> How does Artificial Intelligence (AI) work?</h1>
        <p> AI works through various techniques and algorithms designed to process data, learn from it, and make decisions or predictions. Machine Learning, a subset of AI, enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows machines to understand and generate human language. Computer Vision enables computers to interpret and analyze visual information. These techniques, among others, form the foundation of AI systems.</p>
        <h1 id="tag2" style="margin-left: 60px;"> What are the types of Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h1>
        <p>There are two main types of AI: Narrow AI (Weak AI) and General AI (Strong AI or AGI). Narrow AI is designed to perform specific tasks or a set of tasks, such as virtual personal assistants or recommendation algorithms. General AI, on the other hand, aims to mimic human intelligence across a wide range of tasks, similar to human cognition. Achieving true General AI remains a long-term goal of AI research and development.</p>
        <h1 id="tag3" style="margin-left: 60px;">How is Artificial Intelligence (AI) affecting humans and jobs?</h1>
        <p>AI has the potential to significantly impact society, including the job market. While it can lead to increased efficiency and productivity in various industries, there are concerns about job displacement due to automation. Some tasks previously performed by humans may be automated by AI systems. However, AI also creates new job opportunities, particularly in fields related to AI development, data science, and machine learning. Managing the transition and ensuring that AI benefits society as a whole are important considerations in AI deployment.</p>
        <h1 id="tag4" style="margin-left: 60px;">What are the ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h1>
        <p>The rapid advancement of AI raises ethical concerns regarding its impact on society. These concerns include issues such as algorithmic bias, privacy infringement, job displacement, and the potential for misuse or unintended consequences. Ethical frameworks and regulations are being developed to address these concerns and ensure that AI is deployed responsibly and ethically. It is essential to consider both the benefits and the ethical implications of AI to ensure its positive impact on society.</p>
